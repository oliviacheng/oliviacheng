      <p style="font-size:2vw"><strong>Who am I?</strong>
       I'm an aspiring designer graduating from UC Berkeley this December!</p>
       <p style="font-size:2vw"> <strong>Why am I here?</strong>
        I'm in awe of how far technology has come and the potential it carries.
        Design has the power to tip the scales of this potential to be more
        inclusive and accessible. Designers throw around the word 'empathy' when
        making a product, but it's near impossible to completely understand an
        experience until you have experienced it yourself. (And even then it's
        different). This is a challenge I think everyone should be tackling.</p>
        <p style="font-size:2vw"><strong>I have strong values.</strong>
         Honesty, integrity, grit, kindness, and teamwork. I don't like to assume or judge.</p>
        <p style="font-size:2vw"><strong>What about free time?</strong>
        You can find me at the gym hooping with friends, watching NBA, cooking
        and eating, or kicking back with The Office for the millionth time.</p>
        <p style="font-size:2vw"><strong>Visions?</strong>
         In the future, I hope to be someone who is capable of helping others
        whenever and whereever I want. I want to travel the world and understand
        how different people struggle. I want my work to reflect postitive change
        in this world.</p>
