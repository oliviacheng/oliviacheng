      Why do some people call their new Iphone, "baby"? Because animalistic
      emotions play a key role in attaching humans to technology. How is
      exploring an unknown city like design? You know there will always be a
      surprise discovery; that's what makes testing and user research so
      interesting. And finally, what gives more of a kick than discussing
      something you love with people who care, making an impact, and creating
      an experience? I'm always hungry, always learning, and always listening. . .
